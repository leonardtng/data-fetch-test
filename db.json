Try to imagine a singer scooping a ton of notes, and the phrase “looney tunes” comes to mind, as that singer would sound downright kooky.",

There’s the approach of holding the note out straight for a moment and then vibrato-ing with slightly increasing intensity into the release of the note. Used by players from Dexter Gordon to David Sanborn, this is an extremely common approach to vibrato in jazz and jazz-related music.",

A walking tour of the city surrounding the county courthouse indicated one or two artesian wells per block. It seems reasonable to expect that fixing the town known artesian wells in the courthouse region (plus perhaps one or two additional unknown wells) will stop the artificial discharge of artesian water into the zone and allow the water table to drop back down to its natural level. The work will be conducted in July and August and the groundwater should return the normal levels in time for a successful restoration of the courthouse.",

Over the past few years several 'localized' floods have occurred in the two-block region surrounding the courthouse. These floods develop as a result of rainfall events that are at or near the yearly maximum. The floodwaters have flowed both into the historic courthouse (photos were provided) and the adjoining annex, bordering the parking lot to the east of the courthouse. The floods originate in the vicinity of the parking lot and flow south and west into the courthouse complex, exiting onto the downhill streets adjacent to the courthouse (photos were provided)",

            "description": "The Partial Detention Alternative is the flood mitigation scheme as proposed in the Hogback Detention Master Plan by Graef, Anhalt, Schloemer & Associates, Inc. (February, 1995), commissioned by the city. The plan calls for seven (7) small detention ponds to be formed by constructing low height dams across openings in the lower, eastern hogback. During storm events, ponding behind the dams would remove sediment and reduce peak flows by approximately 50 percent. Volumes of water stored during the 100-year storm would range from 0.4 to 2.0 acre-feet, maximum ponding depths would range from 3.3 to 5.2 feet, and the inundated area would range from 0.15 to 0.35 acres.",
